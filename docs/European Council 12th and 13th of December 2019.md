## What is the European Council?

The European Council is an institution of the European Union that regularly meets once every 3 months.

The European Council consists of:  
- one head of state / government from each of the **28 member states**  
- the President of the European Commission, **Ursula von der Leyen**  
- the President of the European Council, **Charles Michel**

The High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (**Josep Borrell**) and the President of the European Parliament (**David Sassoli**) are usually also in attendance.

The European Council sets out the EU's general direction and political priorities. Sometimes, it negotiates and agrees on issues too contentious for approval by other EU institutions. The European Council generally does not make final legislative decisions, but it does sometimes discuss important legislative issues.

**Note:**  
- This will be the first European Council for Urula von der Leyen as President of the European Commission and Charles Michel as President of the European Council.  
- The United Kingdom will have a Parliamentary election on the 12th. Brexit is a major subject.
